How we treasure the firsts,

unaware of the last,

so sweet yet too fleeting.

Only remembering the past,

hang on to every waking light,

as they are quietly leaving.

There will always be an end,

so hug tightly to everyday,

Short and tense as they can be,

for they will be gone in a whisper

no one will ever disagree

never surrender the love for a child

no matter how tender, 

no matter how wild
