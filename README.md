Resources for life taken from s bunch of blogs, but a lot from zenhabits.com by Leo Babauta

This repo contains a bunch of markdown files that I'm using for different projects. Some are blog posts, drafts, other peoples posts, stiff for my book, stuff for me, but useful and interesting for everyone. 

I'll post some links up once the projects have a little more to them.
